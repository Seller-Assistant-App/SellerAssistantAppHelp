Seller Assistant App compiles all necessary data in one place which means you will be protected from unwanted tabs that slow your computer down.
It’s just convenient.

Important Product Information
The extension window contains all the important information about the product: BSR, ASIN, Parent ASIN, Category, Size (Standard or Oversize), Referral and FBA Fees, Monthly Storage Fee, the number of sellers and competitors, average and minimum prices, the number of reviews for each of the units, the presence of Amazon as a buybox seller and product fragility. Seeing this is important.

Product History

This data is taken directly to the panel that allows you to determine trends in prices, the number of sales, evaluate the competition. All this is essential in the analysis of goods.
