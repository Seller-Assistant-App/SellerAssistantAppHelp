Selling your Private Label.

In this case, you focus on selling one or a few products only, making it possible to keep the sales rates as high and effective as possible; concentrate on the quality of your product, its description, feedback, and pictures; compete with equivalent products.

Amazon Business Models: How to Choose the Right One in 2023?

Selecting a business model is step #2, if not #1, in your product launch. See, why.

Everyone wants to be successful on Amazon until they get to know what it actually takes. Of course, this is a joke. Jokes are half-meant, though. There’s no one-size-fits-all recipe to success on Amazon. At each step of your sales process, you face multiple choices. Thus, making an informed decision in the majority of cases means the right one.

Choosing between the types of Amazon business models is one such step. The business model is the way how you’re going to sell. In other words, this is an approach to your sales process. If you are a first-party seller on Amazon, this is already a pre-selected business model. 

However, third-party sellers (over half of sellers on the platform, according to Amazon itself), have to choose a business model before they start selling a product. 

First and foremost, the choice of the business model depends on the type of product you sell. If you’re thinking about creating a new design, re-branding, or improving the existing product, you’ll select between private label and handmade. 

In turn, if your intention is to resell a product from a supplier or manufacturer, you’ll select between retail arbitrage, online arbitrage, dropshipping, or wholesale. In such a case, the model depends on how much money you have to invest upfront, the time you're ready to spend daily to run your business, and many other criteria.

As a matter of fact, you can combine different models in one seller account depending on what product you sell. Oftentimes, sellers do so on Amazon.

Read our Amazon business models guide to find out the popular Amazon business models and Amazon business models guide examples.

What Are Amazon Business Models?
A business model is an overall approach to selling a product on Amazon. There is no universal business model for Amazon sellers. You’ll need to select one depending on the product you sell, the money you have at hand, and other factors.

Importantly, the business model determines the way how you structure your sales processes on Amazon.

You can use diverse models for different ASINs in your store, the same way you may combine various fulfillment methods – FBA and FBM. 

There are six most popular business models used by Amazon sellers.

Amazon business models are:

private label;
wholesale;
retail arbitrage;
online arbitrage;
dropshipping;
handmade.
Why is Business Model important?
This is because choosing a business model influences ASIN’s price, hence profits. Profit is why you sell, at the end of the day.

The business model, together with the cost of goods and fulfillment method are the main components of the price policy. All other important things like PPC campaigns, fighting for the Buy Box, growing product ranking, and more, are the means to increase sales and outperform the competition. 

For example, if you’ve made up your mind to sell wholesale, your purpose is to find distributors and manufacturers and negotiate down the price for big lots of products. Bulk deals are attractive for suppliers, thus you can get a good price and profit margin. However, you’ll have to invest essential funds upfront. In addition, you’ll need to manage a lot of inventory and store it somewhere.

On the contrary, if you don’t have a lot of money to spend on your Amazon sales right away, the wholesale model is probably not a good choice for you. 

This situation is very typical for a lot of beginners on Amazon. They are not ready to throw a lot of cash into the Amazon business from the start and don’t want to deal with inventory management. In that case, they can go for drop-shipping. Many 7-figure Amazon sellers started from there. This model is relatively easy to set up. However, it implies a number of risks since you have almost no control of the fulfillment process.

That said, you see that to launch a successful product you need to both find a profitable product and figure out how you’re going to sell it. In other words, select one of the Amazon business models.

Amazon Business Models Guide 
On Amazon, some business models are more popular among merchants compared to others. 

For instance, 67% of sellers use private label, 26% - wholesale; 19% - retail arbitrage; and 17% - online arbitrage. The least popular are dropshipping with 9% and handmade with 6%. 

Some of the sellers use more than one business model in their store.

Below, you will find all six Amazon business models explained in detail.

Private label
What is private label?
A private label is basically a re-branding model. With this model, a seller finds an unbranded product, oftentimes from China, or an unknown brand, and creates their own brand out of it. 
This model is used by many retail corporations that operate chains of hypermarkets. These are, for instance, Walmart with its Great Value private-label brand, or Costco with its Kirkland Signature.

Alongside the re-branding, some sellers introduce changes to the initial product. Based on the customer reviews, they ask manufacturers to improve certain product features thus creating added value.

Compared to other models, the private label takes far more time and effort to start. At the same time, the competition is much lower and the profit margins are higher.

Note: Since private label merchants sell new products on Amazon, they need to create new listings. On the other hand, all other sellers, with the exception of handmade, can add their products to existing product listings.

Private label model: pros and cons
Pros:
almost no competition because the brand is unique;
higher profit margin;
full control over price strategy;
a sellable brand is an asset;
possibility to create multiple product lines;
no chance of account suspension.
Cons:
you have to create and optimize product listing;
the necessity for in-depth product research;
you need to manage inventory;
you have to market your products, including pay-per-click (PPC) campaigns;
getting product reviews for a new brand isn’t easy;
certain risks involved since for a new product you can’t see ranking and sales history.
Time and cost to launch a private label product
On average, Amazon sellers spend $2,500 and up to launch private label products. Typically, it takes around three months to start.

How to launch private label product step by step
Step 1. Create a Professional Amazon Seller account. 
Step 2. Enroll in the FBA program for Amazon to take care of picking, packing, and shipping the product (optional).
Step 3. Make product research to find high-demand or low-competition niches.
Step 4. Check the product’s cost of goods. Make sure it’s profitable. https://www.sellerassistant.app/fba-calculator
Step 5. Negotiate with a supplier to brand (and modify) the product.
Step 6. Create a new product page.
Step 7. List your ASIN and promote it.

Note: To calculate ROI and Profit Margin right on your Amazon product page you can use Seller Assistant App’s FBA & FBM Calculator. https://www.sellerassistant.app/fba-calculator

Wholesaling
What is wholesaling?
Wholesale selling is a reselling model. It refers to buying products in bulk from the supplier at a discounted wholesale price. Once done, the wholesaler sells its items to retailers with a profit margin.
With this model, a merchant who buys wholesale has to procure big lots of inventory to get favorable price conditions from the supplier. As far as the per-item price is low, wholesalers are able to squeeze out increased profit margins when they resell inventory to retailers. 

For example, if a retailer asks for a quote from the manufacturer for 200 T-shirts, the price will be $20 per unit. On the other hand, when the wholesaler asks for the same but for 5,000 T-shirts, the manufacturer will give them a discounted price of $10 per unit because of the big lot. Then the wholesaler resells 200 T-shirts to the retailer for $15 per unit and earns $5 on each unit. In this model, all three parties are making a profit.

As a rule, suppliers give priority to bulk orders. Therefore, wholesale sellers are in a good position in terms of pricing and delivery terms.

In addition, this model involves less risk compared to, say, private label. This is because wholesalers mostly sell popular products already existing on Amazon. They have trackable sales history that allows for predicting product sales. For the same reason, there’s no need to spend too much money on ASIN’s promotion. 

To track producr’s sales history and see if sellers had account health issues related to the product or brand you can use Seller Assistant App’s IP Alerts. https://www.sellerassistant.app/ip-alert

For the wholesalers, one of the problems is product and brand restrictions on Amazon. There are products you can’t sell or can sell only with Amazon’s permission. Read more in our article “Amazon Restricted Products – Complete Guide for Sellers”.

https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/amazon-restricted-products-complete-guide-for-sellers

Checking whether you can or can’t sell every single product is a headache unless you use a Seller Assistant App Bulk Restriction checker.

finding a reliable supplier can be a challenge.

Retail arbitrage
What is retail arbitrage?
Retail arbitrage is a model when a merchant finds discounted or cheaper-priced products in brick-and-mortar retail stores and resells them on Amazon with profit.
For instance, if you find a product on Walmart, Big Lots, Target, or Home Depot, that costs $8, and resell it on Amazon for $15, this will be a retail arbitrage sale. The difference between the initial cost of the product and your price on Amazon should cover all Amazon fees and your profit margin. 

Though the model itself is quite straightforward, it has a number of hidden pitfalls. Despite it’s easy and cheap to start, it’s the least profitable model due to high competition. Also, it takes some time until you can get real profits. In addition, it requires a lot of patience to find a good retail arbitrage product.

However, around one-fifth of the sellers use this model. 

Retail arbitrage model: pros and cons
Pros:
fast and easy to set up;
low startup cost;
minimum upfront investment;
low entry-level;

relatively low-profit margins;
takes time to get real profit;
mileage - you have to drive from store to store;
finding a profitable product is not easy;
this model is not a passive source of income.

Online arbitrage
What is online arbitrage?
The principle behind online arbitrage is similar to retail arbitrage - buy low, sell high. Yet, compared to the latter, online arbitrage sellers find their products on the internet, as the name suggests. Thus, this method lacks one of the biggest disadvantages of retail arbitrage – you don’t have to physically roam the brick-and-mortar stores.
There are a lot of places to find online arbitrage products. It can be online selling platforms like eBay, Etsy, and more. You can use Google trends, platforms with hot deals like Brickseek, internet stores of hypermarket chains like Walmart, or AliExpress’s best-sellers list. Also, you can browse single websites of different brands. In addition, Amazon itself is a good source for product ideas. 
https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/amazon-restricted-products-complete-guide-for-sellers

Typically, for the online retailer, the most time-consuming thing is product research. Not only do you need to find a profitable product. You have to check if you can sell it on Amazon or not so that it’s not restricted. You need to see to it that the item isn’t bulk or oversize that involves extra shipping fees.

Online Arbitrage vs Dropshipping: Which Business Model Is Best For You?

Online arbitrage and dropshipping are two popular business models for Amazon sellers. Both models have their own advantages and disadvantages, so it's essential to understand the differences between them before you decide which one is right for you.

Online arbitrage is a good option if you're looking for a low-risk business model with the potential for high profits. However, dropshipping may be a better choice if you're short on time or don't want to deal with inventory management.


In this post, we'll take a closer look at their pros and cons and help you decide which one suits you best.

What Is Online Arbitrage?
Online arbitrage (OA) is the practice of purchasing products from one online retailer and reselling them for a profit on another online marketplace, such as Amazon.
https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/how-to-find-profitable-products-for-amazon-online-arbitrage

That is a low-risk business model, as you don't have to invest in large inventory quantities upfront. However, it can be time-consuming to find products selling for a high profit on Amazon.

Amazon online arbitrage can be a profitable business model, but it is essential to do your research and understand how the process of online arbitrage sourcing works.

What Is Dropshipping?
https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/amazon-fba-vs-dropshipping-which-model-to-choose-for-a-successful-business

Dropshipping is a business model in which the merchant does not keep any inventory they sell in stock. When a shopper places an order, the seller buys the product from a third-party supplier. After that, the supplier delivers the order directly to the customer. In this model, the seller doesn’t see or handle the item.

Dropshipping is a popular business model for online sellers because it allows them to start selling products without investing in inventory or warehousing. That can be a great way to get started in e-commerce, as it has lower entry barriers.

However, there are also some disadvantages to dropshipping. For example, you may have less control over the quality of the products you sell and be more sensitive to shipping delays. 

Note. Amazon allows dropshipping with certain restrictions. You must be the seller of record of your products. That means you must identify yourself as the merchant selling a product to the end customer and include your name and contact information in all product documentation, invoices, and on the packing slip.

Amazon FBA vs Dropshipping: which model to choose for a successful business

Difference between Online Arbitrage and Dropshipping
Online arbitrage and dropshipping are two popular business models for selling products online. Both are used to resell cheaper-priced products to make a profit on Amazon.

However, dropshipping doesn’t involve inventory management, while with online arbitrage, you must deal with inventory. Another crucial difference is that with online arbitrage, you must purchase inventory before selling it to a customer. In contrast, with dropshipping, you don’t purchase the item until the buyer orders it.

Online arbitrage is a low-risk business model and can make you essential money, but it takes a lot of time to find profitable online arbitrage leads. With dropshipping, you don't have to worry about prepaying products or sending them out to customers. However, you will typically make less profit with dropshipping than online arbitrage and have less control over the delivery process.

Pros and Cons of Online Arbitrage
Online arbitrage can be a low-risk way to sell on Amazon, but it's essential to be aware of its potential upsides and downs before starting.

Pros of online arbitrage
Easy-to-start
To begin selling under the OA business model, you just need to have a seller account on Amazon and product research tools to help you find profitable products. There’s no necessity to invest much money in the inventory either. 

High-profit potential
If you can find products selling for a lower price on one online retailer and a higher price on another, you can make a significant profit.

Scalability
You can quickly scale your business by buying more products and selling them on more online marketplaces.

Cons of online arbitrage
Time-consuming
It can be time-consuming to find products selling for a profit on Amazon.

High competition
The online arbitrage market is becoming increasingly competitive, so it can be difficult to find profitable products.

Risk of returns
If a customer returns a product that you bought through online arbitrage, you will be responsible for the return.

Pros and Cons of Dropshipping
Dropshipping can be a great way to start selling on Amazon. However, it is crucial to understand the advantages and disadvantages of this business model before you get started with the items to dropship on Amazon.

Pros of dropshipping
Low start-up costs
You don't need to invest in inventory or warehousing, so you can start selling products with very little money.

Low risk
There’s no necessity for you to invest in the inventory upfront. Therefore, you won't have to worry about losing money on it.

Less profit margin
You will typically make a smaller profit margin on each sale with dropshipping, as you are not the one who sets the product's price.

Which Is the Best — Online Arbitrage or Dropshipping?
When selecting the best model for your business, you must consider your circumstances and preferences. If your target is to do business on Amazon with a small initial capital and get the potential for high profits, then online arbitrage is for you. However, dropshipping may be an option if you are a newbie on Amazon and don't want to deal with inventory management.

Helpful factors in selecting online arbitrage or dropshipping
Your experience level
If you are new to selling online, dropshipping can be a better choice, as it is less complex than online arbitrage.

Your budget
If you have a limited budget, dropshipping may be better for you, as you don't have to invest in inventory upfront.

Your time commitment
If you don't have much time to dedicate to your business, dropshipping may be a better option, as it is less time-consuming to set up and manage.

Your goals
If you are looking to make a lot of money, then online arbitrage may be a better business model. However, dropshipping may be a better option if you want to start a business with low risk.
